* Tanks stay 6 yards apart

### Phase II

#### Option I (see option two in notes)

* Split raid in 2-3 groups and spread out on back side.
* Tank taking [Absolute Zero](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=206585/absolute-zero) run through a single group after each hit to remove the stacks.
* Everyone run [Icy Eection](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=206936/icy-ejection) to the outsides of the platform to keep [Shatter](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=206938/shatter) away from everyone.


### Phase III

* Tanks
    * Perform a taunt swap at 4+ stacks of [Felburst]().
    * Clear the pools of [Felflame]() with the  [Fel Impact]() cast.
* Everyone 
    * Run [Fel Ejection]() to outside of room (favoring door side)

### Phase IV

* Kill adds; clave [Voidlings](); [Thing That Should Not Be]() is TOP priority
