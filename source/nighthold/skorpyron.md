    * Boss tank => face the boss toward the wall and away from the raid.
    * Adds tank => stand on back side of the boss.
    * Raid => Spread out.
    * Stay out of the clouds on the outside of the room (spawns extra adds) 
* Main tank => move 10 yard after [Arcanoslash](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=204275/arcanoslash) to remove [Arcane Tether](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=211659/arcane-tether)  
* Adds
    * Off tank => pick up blue adds, these are the DPS priority
* When he turns toward the raid to cast [Focused Blast](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=204483/focused-blast) move out of the way to avoid the damage
* Hide behind armor shards for [Shockwave](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=204316/shockwave)
